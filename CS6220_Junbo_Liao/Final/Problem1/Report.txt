Problem1:
Part A:
I tried PCA for decomposition, maybe the only algorithm I known that labels is not necessary. And I tried KMeans, DBSCAN, AgglomerativeClustering and Gaussian Mixture:
Gaussian performs best : 
Purity1: 0.7006
Purity2: 0.4388
Mean:  	 0.539623099877

Part B:
I tried SelectKBest and KNN based on 500 selected label( chi2, mutual_info_regression and mutual_info_classif), but they performs bad. Then I tried PCA for decomposition and KNN for clustering, it looks good:
Purity1: 0.562
Purity2: 0.5694
Mean:	 0.565675799894
