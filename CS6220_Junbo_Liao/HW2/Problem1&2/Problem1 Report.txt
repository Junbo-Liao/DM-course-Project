Question A: Prove that E step update on membership achieves the minimum objective given the current centroids
In E step, we add node to the closest cluster, according to the current centroids, if there is a closer cluster, the node would be added into the closer cluster. Thus, E steps achieves the minimum objective given the current centroids.

Question B: Prove that M step update on centroids achieves the minimum objective given the current memberships
In M step, we use the mean of features' value as new centroids so that the distance between each node to center is minimum. Thus, according to current membership, the M step will return the minimum objective


Question C: Explain why KMeans has to stop (converge), but not necessarily to the global minimum objective value. 
Because there are two essential keys for kmeans algorithm, initial center and number of cluster, the result is changeable for different K and first centroids. When KMeans stopped, it means that the clusters is converged only if the program begin with certain k and initial centroids rather than the result is the global minimum.
